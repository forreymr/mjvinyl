## About the Collection and Collector

My name is Meredith Forrey and I am a librarian/information specialist who is interested in getting into digital collections and archives.  This is my sandbox in which to practice skills necessary to the accessibility and functioing of such collections and archives.  I believe in building thoughtful and compassionate communities by connecting people with the information they need.  

My parnter and I have a decent sized collection of vinyl, and have always talked about creating a digital method of browsing that collection.  As time goes on, I hope to add more of our albums to this site, more metadata, and play around with the look and function of the website.

This website is for personal use and personal professional development.  All the images features on this website were photographs taken by me of albums that my partner and I own.  I do not own the copyright to any of the original cover art, and, as such, images from this site should not be copied for use elsewhere.  

Shout out to Olivia Wilkie and Devin Becker from the University of Idaho who gave a great presenation on Collection Builder at the 2019 PNLA confernce.  I have come up with so many ideas on how to use this framework since seeing your talk.
